JSON TO MONGO

- JSON TO MONGO
  
  Hi üñêÔ∏è,this Node.js script is designed to be run from the terminal, allowing users to populate a MongoDB collection with data from a JSON file and,
  if necessary, delete the collection at a later time.
  The script uses the Express framework, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and dotenv for environment variable management.

  To import data:

```sh
$ node json-to-mongo.js --import
```

To delete data:

```sh
$ node json-to-mongo.js --delete
```

That's it! Hope it helps. üòâ
